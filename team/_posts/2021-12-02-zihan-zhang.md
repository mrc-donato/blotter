My name is Zihan Zhang and I am a Ph.D. student at Tufts University. I received a bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Delaware in 2017 and a master’s degree in 2020. My research interests are deep learning, nonvolatile memory, SoC design, and semiconductor devices. Aside from work, I enjoy traveling and listening to hip-hop music.
