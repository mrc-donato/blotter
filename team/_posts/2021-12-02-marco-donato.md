I am an Assistant Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/) at Tufts University. I 
received my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from the Universit√† di Roma La Sapienza in 2008 and 2010, 
respectively, and my Ph.D. degree in Electrical Sciences and Computer Engineering from Brown University, Providence in 2016.
Before joining Tufts, I was a Research Associate in Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences 
working in the [Architecture, Circuits, and Compilers](http://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu) group. My research interests include novel
design methodologies targeting energy-efficient and reliable circuits and architectures for emerging computing paradigms.
