I am an Assistant Professor of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.tufts.edu/ece/) at Tufts University. Before joining Tufts, I was a Research Associate in Harvard University's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences working in the [Architecture, Circuits, and Compilers](http://vlsiarch.eecs.harvard.edu) group.
